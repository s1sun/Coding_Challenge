### 1. Answer for the first challenge (a) [optional]: please refer to PyPlate_answer_a.ipynb file
### 2. Answer for the first challenge (b) : please refer to PyPlate_answer_b.ipynb file
### 3. Answer for the second challenge (a) pear challenge (easy): time vs. intensity data:
(i) examine the raw data
I used the command "format-hex pear | more" from Wondows PowerShell and find 
     (1). each value has 4 bytes
     (2). the first 320 bytes
     (3). the tail 480 bytes are same 
(ii) determine how the data are stored in binary form
Check the corresponding pear_original.csv, each line has one pair (time, intensity) with 2X4 bytes
(iii) write a Python program that converts the binary data into csv form (to parallel the provided csv)
For the python script, please refer to Chromatography_answer_a.py file.
