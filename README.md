# Merck_Coding_Challenge
1. PyPlate is a Python package for designing high-throughput chemistry and biology experiments. Suppose
that you need to screen conditions for 12 cross-coupling reactions of the form:
Ai + Bi → Ci
where Ai and Bi are starting materials, Ci is a product, and i runs from 1…12. For each reaction, let Ai be the
limiting reagent (0.1 mmol), add 1.1 equivalents of Bi, 10 mol% Pd(OAc)2, and 15 mol% of ligand (see below).
