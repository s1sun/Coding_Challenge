Chromatography is frequently used to determine the outcome of experiments. However, most chromatography instrument manufacturers provide data in proprietary data formats. We’ve developed the Rainbow package to unlock these files and we want to know whether you can extend Rainbow. Below has two files with artificially generated and encoded chromatography data:
The goal is figuring out these values from binary file: time vs. wavelength vs. absorbance data
There is binary file, along with a .csv file containing the decoded data. Your job is to:
(i) examine the raw binary data
(ii) determine how the data are stored in binary form
(iii) write a Python program that converts the binary data into csv form (to parallel the provided csv)
The binary raw data looks like below:
